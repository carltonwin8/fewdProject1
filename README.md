## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>
This document is written for the first assignment/project of the
[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)
[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The document is written in markdown using the
[Atom](http://atom.io) editor with the preview page open (ctrl-shift-m) so
that I can see the real time update of the markdown as I type.
